# meta-xt-rcar-gen4 #

This repository contains Renesas RCAR Gen4-specific Yocto layers for
Xen Troops distro. Layers in this repository are
product-independent. They provide common facilities that may be used
by any xt-based product that runs on Resas Gen4-based platforms.

Those layers *may* be added and used manually, but they were written
with [Moulin](https://moulin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) build system,
as Moulin-based project files provide correct entries in local.conf
